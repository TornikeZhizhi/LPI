			<h2>Banking and Finances</h2>

			<p>Georgian law does not make a distinction between commercial and investment banking. In other words, commercial banks are allowed to invest in securities and trade
			them on capital markets.</p>
			<p>The legal framework for commercial banking is established by the Civil Code, the Law of Georgia on Commercial Banking Activities, the Law of Georgia on Entrepreneurs
			and the regulations adopted by the National Bank of Georgia (NBG). Commercial banking is one of the exceptional situations when the form of JSC with a two-tier corporate
			governance system is required.</p>

			<p>The main regulatory body responsible for the control and supervision of commercial banks as well as other nancial institutions (e.g. micro-nance institutions, credit
			unions) is the National Bank of Georgia. Along with this regulatory function, the NBG is also responsible for issuing commercial banking licenses within three (3) months
			of the application. There are two major requirements for a JSC to be granted a commercial banking license (i) evidence of having a minimum regulatory capital in the
			amount and (ii) compliance with t and proper criteria of management.</p>
			
			<p>Micro-Finance Organizations (MFO) control a signicant share of the local commercial lending market, along with commercial banks. The status and activities of
			MFOs are presently regulated by the Law of Georgia on Micro-Finance Organizations, which represents the basic law in this eld.</p>

			<p>Similar to commercial banks, MFOs are subject to licensing from NBG and are required to have a mandatory supervisory board in compliance with the rules contained
			in the Law of Georgia on Entrepreneurs. MFOs are also required to have the form of a JSC or LLC and a minimum charter capital.</p>
